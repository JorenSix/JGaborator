<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The Gaborator performs three main functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>spectrum <i>analysis</i>, which turns a signal into a set
of <i>spectrogram coefficients</i>
<li><i>resynthesis</i> (aka <i>reconstruction</i>), which turns a
set of coefficients back into a signal, and
<li><i>rendering</i>, which
turns a set of coefficients into a rectangular array of
amplitude values that can be turned into pixels to display
a spectrogram.
</ul>

<p>The following sections give a high-level overview of each
of these functions.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>The first step of the analysis is to run the signal through
an <i>analysis filter bank</i>, to split it into a number of
overlapping frequency <i>bands</i>.</p>

<p>The filter bank consists of a number of logarithmically spaced
Gaussian bandpass filters and a single lowpass filter.  Each bandpass
filter has a bandwidth proportional to its center frequency, which
means they all have the same quality factor Q and form
a <i>constant-Q</i> filter bank.  The highest-frequency bandpass
filter will have a center frequency close to half the sample rate; in
the graphs below, this is simple labeled 0.5 because all frequencies
in the Gaborator are in units of the sample rate.  The
lowest-frequency bandpass filter should be centered at, or slightly
below, the lowest frequency of interest to the application at hand.
For example, when analyzing audio, this is often the lower limit of
human hearing; at a sample rate of 44100 Hz, this means 20 Hz / 44100
Hz &asymp; 0.00045.  This lower frequency limit is referred to as
the <i>minimum frequency</i> or f<sub>min</sub>.
</p>

<p>Although frequencies below f<sub>min</sub> are assumed to not be of
interest, they nonetheless need to be preserved to achieve perfect
reconstruction, and that is what the lowpass filter is for.  Together,
the lowpass filter and the bandpass filters overlap to cover the full
frequency range from 0 to 0.5.</P>

<p>The spacing of the bandpass filters is specified by the user as an
integer number of filters (or, equivalently, bands) per octave.  For
example, when analyzing music, this is often 12 bands per octave (one
band per semitone in the equal-tempered scale), or if a finer
frequency resolution is needed, some multiple of 12.</p>

<p>The following plot shows the frequency responses of the analysis
filters at 12 bands per octave and f<sub>min</sub> = 0.03.  A more
typical f<sub>min</sub> for audio work would be 0.00045, but
that would make the plot hard to read because both the lowpass filter
and the lowest-frequency bandpass filters would be extremely narrow.</p>

<p>The output of each bandpass filter is shifted down in frequency to
a complex quadrature baseband.  The baseband signal is then resampled
at a reduced sample rate, lower than that of the orignal signal but
high enough that there is negligible aliasing given the bandwidth of
the filter in case.  The Gaborator uses sample rates related to the
original signal sample rate by powers of two.  This means some of
frequency bands are sampled a bit more often than strictly
necessary, but has the advantage that the sampling can be synchronized
to make the samples of many frequency bands coincide in time, which
can be convenient in later analysis or spectrogram rendering.  The
complex samples resulting from this process are the spectrogram
coefficients.</p>

<p>The center frequencies of the analysis filters and the points in
time at which they are sampled form a two-dimensional,
multi-resolution <i>time-frequency grid</i>, where high frequencies
are sampled sparsely in frequency but densely in time, and low
frequencies are sampled densely in frequency but sparsely in time.</p>

<p>The following plot illustrates the time-frequency sampling grid
corresponding to the parameters used in the previous plot.  Note that
frequency was the X axis in the previous plot, but is the Y axis
here.  The plot covers a time range of 128 signal samples, but
conceptually, the grid extends arbitrarily far in time, in both the
positive and the negative direction.</p>

<h2>Resynthesis</h2>

<p>Resynthesizing a signal from the coefficients is more or less the
reverse of the analysis process.  The coefficients are frequency
shifted from the complex baseband back to their original center
frequencies and run through a <i>reconstruction filter bank</i>
that is a <i>dual</i> of the analysis filter bank.  The following
plot shows the frequency responses of the reconstruction filters
corresponding to the analysis filters shown earlier.</p>

<p>Although the bandpass filters may look similar to the Gaussian
filters of the analysis filter bank, their shapes are actually subtly
different.</p>

<h2>Spectrogram Rendering</h2>

<p>Rendering a spectrogram image from the coefficients involves
taking the magnitude of each complex coefficient, and then
resampling the resulting multi-resolution grid of magnitudes
into to an evenly spaced pixel grid.</p>

<p>Because the coefficient sample rate varies by frequency band, the
resampling required in the horizontal (time) direction also varies.
Typically, the high-frequency bands of an audio spectrogram have more
than one coefficient per pixel and require downsampling (decimation),
some bands  in the mid-range frequencies have a one-to-one relationship
between coefficients and pixels, and the low-frequency bands
have more than one pixel per coefficient and require upsampling
(interpolation).</p>
