<h1>The Gaborator</h1>
<p>The Gaborator is a library that generates constant-Q spectrograms
for visualization and analysis of audio signals.  It also supports an
accurate inverse transformation of the spectrogram coefficients back into
audio for spectral effects and editing.</p>

<p>The Gaborator implements the invertible constant-Q transform of
Velasco, Holighaus, D&ouml;rfler, and Grill, described in the papers
<i><a href="http://www.univie.ac.at/nonstatgab/pdf_files/dohogrve11_amsart.pdf">
Constructing an invertible constant-Q transform with nonstationary Gabor frames, 2011</a></i>
and <i><a href="http://www.univie.ac.at/nonstatgab/pdf_files/dogrhove12_amsart.pdf">
A Framework for invertible, real-time constant-Q transforms, 2012</a></i>,
using Gaussian bandpass filters and an efficient multi-rate architecture.
</p>

<p>The Gaborator is written in C++11 and runs on POSIX systems such as
macOS, Linux, and NetBSD.  It has been tested on Intel x86_64 and ARM
processors.</p>

<p>The Gaborator is open source under the GNU Affero General Public
License, version 3, and is also available for commercial licensing.
See the file <a href="../LICENSE">LICENSE</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>This is still an early release, and API changes are expected.</p>

<p>The distribution includes the core spectrum analysis, resynthesis, and
spectrogram rendering code, along with some example code and documentation.
Some features that have been implemented but are not yet ready for
release have been omitted, for example the support for parallel
analysis and synthesis using multiple CPU cores. Also, the current API
still lacks functions for convenient row- or column-wise access to
the coefficients at specific frequencies or times; the only way to
access the coefficients is the apply() method, which iterates over
the entire coefficient set or a time range in an indeterminate
order.
</p>

<h2>Example Code</h2>

<p>The following examples demonstrate the use of the library for
various applications.  They are presented in a "literate
programming" style, with the code embedded in the commentary
rather than the other way around.
Concatenating the code fragments in each example yields a complete C++
program, which can also be found as a <code>.cc</code> file in
the <code>examples/</code> directory.</p>
