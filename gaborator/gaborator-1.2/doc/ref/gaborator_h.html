<h1>Gaborator reference: <code>gaborator.h</code></h1>

<h2><code>class gaborator::parameters</code></h2>

<p>A <code>parameters</code> object holds a set
of spectrum analysis parameters.</p>

<h3>Constructor</h3>
<pre>
gaborator::parameters::parameters(unsigned int bands_per_octave,
                                  double ff_min,
                                  double ff_ref = 1.0)
</pre>
<dl>
  <dt><code>bands_per_octave</code></dt>
  <dd>The number of frequency bands per octave.
  Values from 6 to 192 (inclusive) are supported.  Values outside
  this range may not work, or may cause degraded performance.</dd>
  <dt><code>ff_min</code></dt>
  <dd>The lower limit of the analysis frequency range, in units of the
  sample rate.  The analysis filter bank will extend low enough in
  frequency that <code>ff_min</code> falls between the two lowest
  frequency bandpass filters.
  Values from 0.001 to 0.13 are supported.</dd>
  <dt><code>ff_ref</code></dt>
  <dd>The reference frequency, in units of the sample rate.
  This allows fine-tuning of the analysis and synthesis filter
  banks such that the center frequency of one of the filters
  is aligned with <code>ff_ref</code>.  If <code>ff_ref</code>
  falls outside the frequency range of the filter bank, this
  works as if the range were extended to include
  <code>ff_ref</code>.  Must be positive.  A typical value
  when analyzing music is <code>440.0 / fs</code>, where
  <code>fs</code> is the sample rate in Hz.
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Comparison</h3>
<p>
Comparison operators are provided for compatibility with
standard container classes.  The ordering is arbitrary but consistent.
</p>
<pre>
bool gaborator::parameters::operator<(const gaborator::parameters &amp;rhs) const
bool gaborator::parameters::operator==(const gaborator::parameters &amp;rhs) const
</pre>

<h2><code>template&lt;class T&gt; class gaborator::coefs</code></h2>
<p>
A <code>coefs</code> object stores a set of spectrogram coefficients.
It is a dynamic data structure and will be automatically grown to
accommodate new time ranges as they are analyzed by calling
<code>analyzer::analyze()</code>.  The template argument <code>T</code>
must match that of the <code>analyzer</code> (usually <code>float</code>).
</p>
<h3>Constructor</h3>
<pre>
gaborator::coefs::coefs(gaborator::analyzer &amp;a)
</pre>
<p>
Construct an empty set of coefficients for use with the spectrum
analyzer <code>a</code>.  This represents a signal that is zero
at all points in time.
</p>

<h2><code>template&lt;class T&gt; class gaborator::analyzer</code></h2>
<p>
The <code>analyzer</code> object performs spectrum analysis and/or resynthesis
according to the given parameters.  The template argument <code>T</code> is
the floating-point type to use for the calculations.  This is typically <code>float</code>;
alternatively, <code>double</code> can be used for increased accuracy at the
expense of speed and memory consumption.</p>

<h3>Constructor</h3>

<pre>
gaborator::analyzer::analyzer(const gaborator::parameters &amp;params)
</pre>
<dl>
  <dt><code>params</code></dt>
  <dd>The spectrum analysis parameters.
</dl>

<h3>Analysis and synthesis</h3>

<pre>
void
gaborator::analyzer::analyze(const T *signal,
                     int64_t t0,
                     int64_t t1,
                     gaborator::coefs&lt;T&gt; &amp;coefs) const
</pre>
<p>Spectrum analyze the samples at <code>*signal</code> and add the
resulting coefficients to <code>coefs</code>.
<dl>
  <dt><code>signal</code></dt>
  <dd>The signal samples to analyze, beginning with the sample from time <code>t0</code>,
  and numbering <code>t1 - t0</code> in all.
  <dt><code>t0</code></dt>
  <dd>The point in time when the sample at <code>signal[0]</code> was taken,
  in samples. By convention, this is 0 for the first sample in
  the audio track, but this reference point is arbitrary, and
  negative times are valid.  Accuracy begins to successively decrease
  outside the range of about &plusmn;10<sup>8</sup> samples, so using
  large time values should be avoided when they are not necessary because
  of the length of the track.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>t1</code></dt>
  <dd>The point in time of the sample one past the
  end of the array of samples at <code>signal</code>,
  in samples.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>coefs</code></dt><dd>The coefficient object that the results of the
  spectrum analysis are added to.
</dl>
<p>If the <code>coefs</code> object already contains some
coefficients, the new coefficients are summed to those already
present.  Because the analysis is a linear operation, this allows a
signal to be analyzed in parts, by making multiple calls
to <code>analyze()</code> with non-overlapping ranges that together
cover the entire signal.  For efficiency, the ranges should preferably
be large and aligned on multiples of a large powers of two, as in
<code>analyze(first_131072_samples, 0, 131072, coefs)</code>,
<code>analyze(next_131072_samples, 131072, 262144, coefs)</code>,
etc.
</p>

<pre>
void
gaborator::analyzer::synthesize(const gaborator::coefs&lt;T&gt; &amp;coefs,
                                uint64_t t0,
                                uint64_t t1,
                                T *signal) const
</pre>
<p>Synthesize signal samples from the coefficients <code>coef</code> and store
them at <code>*signal</code>.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>coefs</code></dt><dd>The coefficients to synthesize the signal from.</dd>
  <dt><code>t0</code></dt>
  <dd>The point in time of the first sample to synthesize,
  in samples, using the same time scale as in <code>analyze()</code>.</dd>
  <dt><code>t0</code></dt>
  <dd>The point in time of the sample one past the last one to synthesize.</dd>
  <dt><code>signal</code></dt>
  <dd>The synthesized signal samples will be written here,
  beginning with the sample from time <code>t0</code>,
  and numbering <code>t1 - t0</code> in all.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The time range <code>t0</code>...<code>t1</code>
may extend outside the range analyzed using <code>analyze()</code>,
in which case the signal is assumed to be zero in the un-analyzed range.</p>

<h3>Frequency Band Numbering</h3>

<p>The frequency bands of the analysis filter bank are numbered by
nonnegative integers that increase towards lower (sic) frequencies.
There is a number of <i>bandpass bands</i> corresponding to the
logarithmically spaced bandpass analysis filters, from near 0.5
(half the sample rate) to
near f<sub>min</sub>, and a single <i>lowpass band</i> containing the
residual signal from frequencies below f<sub>min</sub>.
The numbering can be examined using the following methods:
</p>

<pre>
int gaborator::analyzer::bandpass_bands_begin() const
</pre>
<p>
Return the smallest valid bandpass band number, corresponding to the highest-frequency
bandpass filter.</p>
<pre>
int gaborator::analyzer::bandpass_bands_end() const
</pre>
<p>
Return the bandpass band number one past the highest valid bandpass band number,
corresponding to one past the lowest-frequency bandpass filter.</p>
<pre>
int gaborator::analyzer::band_lowpass() const
</pre>
<p>
Return the band number of the lowpass band.</p>
<pre>
int gaborator::analyzer::band_ff(int band) const
</pre>
<p>
Return the center frequency of band number <i>band</i>, in units of the
sampling frequency.
</p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<pre>
double gaborator::analyzer::analysis_support() const
</pre>
<p>Returns the one-sided worst-case <i>support</i> of any of the analysis filters.
When calling <code>analyze()</code> with a sample at time <i>t</i>,
only spectrogram coefficients within the time range <i>t &plusmn; support</i>
will be significantly changed.  Coefficients outside the range may change,
but the changes will sufficiently small that they may be ignored without
significantly reducing accuracy.</p>

<pre>
double gaborator::analyzer::synthesis_support() const
</pre>
<p>Returns the one-side worst-cased <i>support</i> of any of the
reconstruction filters.  When calling <code>synthesize()</code> to
synthesize a sample at time <i>t</i>, the sample will only be
significantly affected by spectrogram coefficients in the time
range <i>t &plusmn; support</i>.  Coefficients outside the range may
be used in the synthesis, but substituting zeroes for the actual
coefficient values will not significantly reduce accuracy.</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<h3>Iterating Over the Coefficients</h3>

<pre>
template &lt;class T, class F&gt;
void gaborator::apply(const gaborator::analyzer&lt;T&gt; &amp;a,
                      const gaborator::coefs&lt;T&gt; &amp;c,
                      F f)
</pre>
<p>
Apply the function <code>f</code> to each coefficient in the coefficient set <code>c</code>.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>a</code></dt>
  <dd>The spectrum analyzer that produced the coefficients <code>c</code></dd>
  <dt><code>c</code></dt>
  <dd>A set of spectrogram coefficients</dd>
  <dt><code>f</code></dt>
  <dd>A function to apply to each coefficient in <code>c</code>,
  with the call signature
    <pre>void f(std::complex&lt;float&gt; &amp;coef, int band, int64_t t)</pre>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>coef</code></dt>
      <dd>A reference to a single complex coefficient.  This may be read and
        optionally modified in-place.</dd>
      <dt><code>band</code></dt>
      <dd>The band number of the frequency band the coefficient <code>coef</code> pertains to.
        This may be either a bandpass band or the lowpass band.</dd>
      <dt><code>t</code></dt>
      <dd>The point in time the coefficient <code>coef</code> pertains to, in samples</dd>
    </dl>
    </dd>
</dl>
<pre>
template &lt;class T, class F&gt;
void gaborator::apply(const gaborator::analyzer&lt;T&gt; &amp;a,
                      const gaborator::coefs&lt;T&gt; &amp;c,
                      F f,
                      int64_t t0,
                      int64_t t1)
</pre>
<p>
As above, but only apply the function <code>f</code> to the coefficients
for points in time <i>t</i> that satisfy <i>t0 <= t < t1</i>.
</p>

<h3>Forgetting Coefficients</h3>
<pre>
template <class T>
void gaborator::forget_before(const gaborator::analyzer&lt;T&gt; &a,
                              gaborator::coefs&ltT&gt &c,
                              int64_t limit)
</pre>
<p>Allow the coefficients for points in time before <code>limit</code>
(a time in units of samples) to be forgotten.
Streaming applications can use this to free memory used by coefficients
that are no longer needed.  Coefficients that have been forgotten will
read as zero.  This does not guarantee that all coefficients before
<code>limit</code> are forgotten, only that ones for
<code>limit</code> or later are not, and that the amount of memory
consumed by any remaining coefficients before <code>limit</code> is
bounded.</p>
