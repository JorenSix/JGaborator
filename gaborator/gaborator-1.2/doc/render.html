<title>Gaborator Example 1: Rendering a Spectrogram Image</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Example 1: Rendering a Spectrogram Image</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This example shows how to generate a greyscale constant-Q
spectrogram image from an audio file using the Gaborator library.
</p>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>We start off with some boilerplate #includes.</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;memory.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;sndfile.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>The Gaborator is a header-only library &mdash; there are no C++ files
to compile, only header files to include.
The core spectrum analysis and resynthesis code is in
<code>gaborator/gaborator.h</code>, and the code for rendering
images from the spectrogram coefficients is in
<code>gaborator/render.h</code>.</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;gaborator/gaborator.h&gt;
#include &lt;gaborator/render.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>The program takes the names of the input audio file and output spectrogram
image file as command line arguments, so we check that they are present:</p>

<pre>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc &lt; 3) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "usage: render input.wav output.pgm\n";
        exit(1);
    }
</pre>

<h2>Reading the Audio</h2>

<p>The audio file is read using the <i>libsndfile</i> library
and stored in a <code>std::vector&lt;float&gt;</code>.
Note that although <i>libsndfile</i> is used in this example,
the Gaborator library itself does not depend or
use <i>libsndfile</i>.</p>
<pre>
    SF_INFO sfinfo;
    memset(&amp;sfinfo, 0, sizeof(sfinfo));
    SNDFILE *sf_in = sf_open(argv[1], SFM_READ, &amp;sfinfo);
    if (! sf_in) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "could not open input audio file\n";
        exit(1);
    }
    double fs = sfinfo.samplerate;
    sf_count_t n_frames = sfinfo.frames;
    sf_count_t n_samples = sfinfo.frames * sfinfo.channels;
    std::vector&lt;float&gt; audio(n_samples);
    sf_count_t n_read = sf_readf_float(sf_in, audio.data(), n_frames);
    if (n_read != n_frames) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "read error\n";
        exit(1);
    }
    sf_close(sf_in);
</pre>
<p>In case the audio file is a stereo or multi-channel one,
mix down the channels to mono, into a new <code>std::vector&lt;float&gt;</code>:
<pre>
    std::vector&lt;float&gt; mono(n_frames);
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; (size_t)n_frames; i++) {
        float v = 0;
        for (size_t c = 0; c &lt; (size_t)sfinfo.channels; c++)
            v += audio[i * sfinfo.channels + c];
        mono[i] = v;
    }
</pre>

<h2>The Spectrum Analysis Parameters</h2>

<p>Next, we need to choose some parameters for the spectrum analysis:
the frequency resolution, the frequency range, and optionally a
reference frequency.</p>

<p>The frequency resolution is specified as a number of frequency
bands per octave.  A typical number for analyzing music signals is 48
bands per octave, or in other words, four bands per semitone
in the 12-note equal tempered scale.</p>

<p>The frequency range is specified by giving a minimum frequency;
this is the lowest frequency that will be included in the spectrogram
display.
For audio signals, a typical minimum frequency is 20&nbsp;Hz,
the lower limit of human hearing.  In the Gaborator library,
all frequencies are given in units of the sample rate rather
than in Hz, so we need to divide the 20&nbsp;Hz by the sample
rate of the input audio file: <code>20.0 / fs</code>.</p>

<p>Unlike the minimum frequency, the maximum frequency is not given
explicitly &mdash; instead, the analysis always produces coefficients
for frequencies all the way up to half the sample rate
(a.k.a. the Nyquist frequency).  If you don't need the coefficients
for the highest frequencies, you can simply ignore them.</p>

<p>If desired, one of the frequency bands can be exactly aligned with
a <i>reference frequency</i>.  When analyzing music signals, this is
typically 440 Hz, the standard tuning of the note <i>A<sub>4</sub></i>.
Like the minimum frequency, it is given in
units of the sample rate, so we pass <code>440.0 / fs</code>.</p>

<p>The parameters are held in an object of type
<code>gaborator::parameters</code>:
<pre>
    gaborator::parameters params(48, 20.0 / fs, 440.0 / fs);
</pre>

<h2>The Spectrum Analyzer</h2>

<p>Next, we create an object of type <code>gaborator::analyzer</code>;
this is the workhorse that performs the actual spectrum analysis
(and/or resynthesis, but that's for a later example).
It is a template class, parametrized by the floating point type to
use for the calculations; this is typically <code>float</code>.
Constructing the <code>gaborator::analyzer</code> involves allocating and
precalculating all the filter coefficients and other auxiliary data needed
for the analysis and resynthesis, and this takes considerable time and memory,
so when analyzing multiple pieces of audio with the same
parameters, creating a single <code>gaborator::analyzer</code>
and reusing it is preferable to destroying and recreating it.</p>
<pre>
    gaborator::analyzer&lt;float&gt; analyzer(params);
</pre>

<h2>The Spectrogram Coefficients</h2>

<p>The result of the spectrum analysis will be a set of <i>spectrogram
coefficients</i>.  To store them, we will use a <code>gaborator::coefs</code>
object.  Like the <code>analyzer</code>, this is a template class parametrized
by the data type.  Because the layout of the coefficients is determined by
the spectrum analyzer, it must be passed as an argument to the constructor:</p>
<pre>
    gaborator::coefs&lt;float&gt; coefs(analyzer);
</pre>

<h2>Running the Analysis</h2>

<p>Now we are ready to do the actual spectrum analysis,
by calling the <code>analyze</code> method of the spectrum
analyzer object.
The first argument to <code>analyze</code> is a <code>float</code> pointer
pointing to the first element in the array of samples to analyze.
The second and third arguments are of type
<code>int64_t</code> and indicate the time range covered by the
array, in units of samples.  Since we are passing the whole file at
once, the beginning of the range is sample number zero, and the end is
sample number <code>mono.size()</code>.  The fourth argument is a
reference to the set of coefficients that the results of the spectrum
analysis will be stored in.
</p>
<pre>
    analyzer.analyze(mono.data(), 0, mono.size(), coefs);
</pre>

<h2>Rendering an Image</h2>

<p>Now there is a set of spectrogram coefficients in <code>coefs</code>.
To render them as an image, we will use the function
<code>gaborator::render_p2scale()</code>.
</p>

<p>Rendering involves two different coordinate
spaces: the time-frequency coordinates of the spectrogram
coefficients, and the x-y coordinates of the image.
The two spaces are related by an origin and a scale factor,
each with an x and y component.</p>

<p>The origin specifies the point in time-frequency space that
corresponds to the pixel coordinates (0, 0).  Here, we will
use an origin where the x (time) component
is zero (the beginning of the signal), and the y (frequency) component
is the band number of the first (highest frequency) band:</p>

<pre>
    int64_t x_origin = 0;
    int64_t y_origin = analyzer.bandpass_bands_begin();
</pre>

<p><code>render_p2scale()</code> supports scaling the spectrogram in
both the time (horizontal) and frequency (vertical) dimension, but only
by power-of-two scale factors.  These scale factors are specified
relative to a reference scale of one vertical pixel per frequency band
and one horizontal pixel per signal sample.

<p>Although a horizontal scale of one pixel per signal sample is a
mathematically pleasing reference point, this reference scale is not
used in practice because it would result in spectrogram that is much
too stretched out horizontally.  A more typical scale factor might be
2<sup>10</sup> = 1024, yielding one pixel for every 1024 signal
samples, which is about one pixel per 23 milliseconds of signal at a
sample rate of 44.1 kHz.</p>
<pre>
    int x_scale_exp = 10;
</pre>

<p>To ensure that the spectrogram will fit on the screen even in the
case of a long audio file, let's auto-scale it down further until
it is no more than 1000 pixels wide:</p>
<pre>
    while ((n_frames &gt;&gt; x_scale_exp) &gt; 1000)
        x_scale_exp++;
</pre>

<p>In the vertical, the reference scale factor of one pixel per
frequency band is reasonable, so we will use it as-is.  In other words,
the vertical scale factor will be 2<sup>0</sup>.</p>
<pre>
    int y_scale_exp = 0;
</pre>

<p>Next, we need to define the rectangular region of the image
coordinate space to render.  Since we are rendering the entire
spectrogram rather than a tile, the top left corner of the
rectangle will have an origin of (0, 0).
</p>

<pre>
    int64_t x0 = 0;
    int64_t y0 = 0;
</pre>

<p>The coordinates of the bottom right corner are determined by the
length of the signal and the number of bands, respectively, taking the
scale factors into account.
The length of the signal in samples is <code>n_frames</code>,
and we get the number of bands as the difference of the end points of
the range of band numbers:
<code>analyzer.bandpass_bands_end() - analyzer.bandpass_bands_begin()</code>.
The scale factor is taken into account by right shifting by the
scale exponent.
</p>

<pre>
    int64_t x1 = n_frames &gt;&gt; x_scale_exp;
    int64_t y1 = (analyzer.bandpass_bands_end() - analyzer.bandpass_bands_begin()) &gt;&gt; y_scale_exp;
</pre>

<p>The right shift by <code>y_scale_exp</code> above doesn't actually
do anything because <code>y_scale_exp</code> is zero, but it would be
needed if, for example, you were to change <code>y_scale_exp</code> to
1 to get a spectrogram scaled to half the height.  You could also make a
double-height spectrogram by setting <code>y_scale_exp</code> to -1,
but then you also need to change the
<code>&gt;&gt; y_scale_exp</code> to
<code>&lt;&lt; -y_scale_exp</code> since you can't shift by
a negative number.
</p>

<p>We are now ready to render the spectrogram, producing
a vector of floating-point amplitude values, one per pixel.
Although this is stored as a 1-dimensional vector of floats, its
contents should be interpreted as a 2-dimensional rectangular array of
<code>(y1 - y0)</code> rows of <code>(x1 - x0)</code> columns
each, with the row indices increasing towards lower
frequencies and column indices increasing towards later
sampling times.
</p>
<pre>
    std::vector&lt;float&gt; amplitudes((x1 - x0) * (y1 - y0));
    gaborator::render_p2scale(
        analyzer,
        coefs,
        x_origin, y_origin,
        x0, x1, x_scale_exp,
        y0, y1, y_scale_exp,
        amplitudes.data());
</pre>

<h2>Writing the Image File</h2>

<p>To keep the code simple and to avoid additional library
dependencies, the image is stored in
<code>pgm</code> (Portable GreyMap) format, which is simple
enough to be generated with just a few lines of inline code.
Each amplitude value in <code>amplitudes</code> is converted into an 8-bit
gamma corrected pixel value by calling <code>gaborator::float2pixel_8bit()</code>.
To control the brightness of the resulting image, each
amplitude value is multiplied by a gain; this may have to be adjusted
depending on the type of signal and the amount of headroom in the
recording, but a gain of about 15 often works well for typical music
signals.</p>
<pre>
    float gain = 15;
    std::ofstream f;
    f.open(argv[2], std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);
    f << "P5\n" << (x1 - x0) << ' ' << (y1 - y0) << "\n255\n";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < amplitudes.size(); i++)
        f.put(gaborator::float2pixel_8bit(amplitudes[i] * gain));
    f.close();
</pre>

<h2>Postamble</h2>
<p>
To make the example code a complete program,
we just need to finish <code>main()</code>:
</p>
<pre>
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>
If you are using macOS, Linux, NetBSD, or a similar system, you can build
the example by running the following command in the <code>examples</code>
subdirectory.
You need to have <i>libsndfile</i> is installed and supported by
<code>pkg-config</code>.
</p>
<pre class="build Darwin Linux NetBSD">
c++ -std=c++11 -I.. -O3 -ffast-math `pkg-config --cflags sndfile` render.cc `pkg-config --libs sndfile` -o render
</pre>

<h2>Compiling for Speed</h2>
<p>The above build command uses the Gaborator's built-in FFT implementation,
which is simple and portable but rather slow.  Performance can be
significantly improved by using a faster FFT library.  On macOS, you
can use the FFT from Apple's vDSP library by defining
<code>GABORATOR_USE_VDSP</code> and linking with the <code>Accelerate</code>
framework:
</p>
<pre class="build Darwin">
c++ -std=c++11 -I.. -O3 -ffast-math -DGABORATOR_USE_VDSP `pkg-config --cflags sndfile` render.cc `pkg-config --libs sndfile` -framework Accelerate -o render
</pre>

<p>On Linux and NetBSD, you can use the PFFFT (Pretty Fast FFT) library.
You can get the latest version from
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jpommier/pffft">https://bitbucket.org/jpommier/pffft</a>,
or the exact version that was used for testing from gaborator.com:
</p>
<!-- ftp https://bitbucket.org/jpommier/pffft/get/29e4f76ac53b.zip -->
<pre class="build Linux NetBSD">
wget http://download.gaborator.com/mirror/pffft/29e4f76ac53b.zip
unzip 29e4f76ac53b.zip
mv jpommier-pffft-29e4f76ac53b pffft
</pre>
<p>Then, compile it:</p>
<pre class="build Linux NetBSD">
cc -c -O3 -ffast-math pffft/pffft.c -o pffft/pffft.o
</pre>
<p>(If you are building for ARM, you will need to add <code>-mfpu=neon</code> to
both the above compilation command and the ones below.)</p>
<p>PFFFT is single precision only, but it comes with a copy of FFTPACK which can
be used for double-precision FFTs.  Let's compile that, too:</p>
<pre class="build Linux NetBSD">
cc -c -O3 -ffast-math -DFFTPACK_DOUBLE_PRECISION pffft/fftpack.c -o pffft/fftpack.o
</pre>
<p>Then build the example and link it with both PFFFT and FFTPACK:</p>
<pre class="build Linux NetBSD">
c++ -std=c++11 -I.. -Ipffft -O3 -ffast-math -DGABORATOR_USE_PFFFT `pkg-config --cflags sndfile` render.cc pffft/pffft.o pffft/fftpack.o `pkg-config --libs sndfile` -o render
</pre>

<h2>Running</h2>
<p>Running the following shell commands will download a short example
audio file (of picking each string on an acoustic guitar), generate
a spectrogram from it as a <code>.pgm</code> image, and then convert
the <code>.pgm</code> image into a <code>JPEG</code> image:
<pre class="run">
wget http://download.gaborator.com/audio/guitar.wav
./render guitar.wav guitar.pgm
cjpeg &lt;guitar.pgm &gt;guitar.jpg
</pre>

<h2>Example Output</h2>
<p>The JPEG file produced by the above will look like this:</p>
<img src="spectrogram.jpg" alt="Spectrogram" data-autogen="no">
