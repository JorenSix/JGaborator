<title>Gaborator Example 2: Frequency-Domain Filtering</title>
</head>

<h1>Example 2: Frequency-Domain Filtering</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This example shows how to apply a filter to an audio file using
the Gaborator library, by turning the audio into spectrogram
coefficients, modifying the coefficients, and resynthesizing audio
from them.</p>

<p>The specific filter implemented here is a 3 dB/octave lowpass
filter.  This is sometimes called a <i>pinking filter</i> because it
can be used to produce pink noise from white noise.  In practice, the
3 dB/octave slope is only applied above some minimum frequency, for
example 20 Hz, because otherwise the gain of the filter would approach
infinity as the frequency approaches 0, and the impulse response would
have to be infinitely wide.
</p>

<p>Since the slope of this filter is not a multiple of 6 dB/octave, it
is difficult to implement as an analog filter, but by filtering
digitally in the frequency domain, arbitrary filter responses such as
this can easily be achieved.
</p>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<pre>
#include &lt;memory.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;sndfile.h&gt;
#include &lt;gaborator/gaborator.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc &lt; 3) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "usage: filter input.wav output.wav\n";
        exit(1);
    }
</pre>

<h2>Reading the Audio</h2>

<p>The code for reading the input audio file is identical to
that in <a href="render.html">Example 1</a>:</p>

<pre>
    SF_INFO sfinfo;
    memset(&amp;sfinfo, 0, sizeof(sfinfo));
    SNDFILE *sf_in = sf_open(argv[1], SFM_READ, &amp;sfinfo);
    if (! sf_in) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "could not open input audio file\n";
        exit(1);
    }
    double fs = sfinfo.samplerate;
    sf_count_t n_frames = sfinfo.frames;
    sf_count_t n_samples = sfinfo.frames * sfinfo.channels;
    std::vector&lt;float&gt; audio(n_samples);
    sf_count_t n_read = sf_readf_float(sf_in, audio.data(), n_frames);
    if (n_read != n_frames) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "read error\n";
        exit(1);
    }
    sf_close(sf_in);
</pre>

<h2>Spectrum Analysis Parameters</h2>

<p>The spectrum analysis works much the same as in Example 1,
but uses slightly different parameters.
We use a larger number of frequency bands per octave (100)
to minimize ripple in the frequency response, and the
reference frequency argument is omitted as we don't care about the
exact alignment of the bands with respect to a musical scale.</p>
<pre>
    gaborator::parameters params(100, 20.0 / fs);
    gaborator::analyzer&lt;float&gt; analyzer(params);
</pre>

<h2>Precalculating Gains</h2>

<p>The filtering will be done by multiplying each spectrogram
coefficient with a frequency-dependent gain.  To avoid having to
calculate the gain on the fly for each coefficient, which would
be slow, we will precalculate the gains into a vector <code>band_gains</code>
of one gain value per band, including one for the
special lowpass band that contains the frequencies from 0 to 20 Hz.</p>

<pre>
    std::vector&lt;float&gt; band_gains(analyzer.bands_end());
</pre>

<p>First, we calculate the gains for the bandpass bands.
For a 3 dB/octave lowpass filter, the voltage gain needs to be
proportional to the square root of the inverse of the frequency.
To get the frequency of each band, we call the
<code>analyzer</code> method <code>band_ff()</code>, which
returns the center frequency of the band in units of the
sampling frequency.  The gain is normalized to unity at 20 Hz.
</p>
<pre>
    for (int band = analyzer.bandpass_bands_begin(); band &lt; analyzer.bandpass_bands_end(); band++) {
        float f_hz = analyzer.band_ff(band) * fs;
        band_gains[band] = 1.0 / sqrt(f_hz / 20.0);
    }
</pre>

<p>The gain of the lowpass band is set to the the same value as the
lowest-frequency bandpass band, so that the overall filter gain
plateaus smoothly to a constant value below 20&nbsp;Hz.</p>

<pre>
    band_gains[analyzer.band_lowpass()] = band_gains[analyzer.bandpass_bands_end() - 1];
</pre>

<h2>De-interleaving</h2>

<p>To handle stereo and other multi-channel audio files,
we will loop over the channels and filter each channel separately.
Since <i>libsndfile</i> produces interleaved samples, we first
de-interleave the current channel into a temporary vector called
<code>channel</code>:</p>
<pre>
    for (sf_count_t ch = 0; ch &lt; sfinfo.channels; ch++) {
        std::vector&lt;float&gt; channel(n_frames);
        for (sf_count_t i = 0; i &lt; n_frames; i++)
            channel[i] = audio[i * sfinfo.channels + ch];
</pre>
<h2>Spectrum Analysis</h2>
<p>Now we can spectrum analyze the current channel, producing
a set of coefficients:</p>
<pre>
        gaborator::coefs&lt;float&gt; coefs(analyzer);
        analyzer.analyze(channel.data(), 0, channel.size(), coefs);
</pre>

<h2>Filtering</h2>
<p>
The filtering is done using the function
<code>gaborator::apply()</code>, which applies a user-defined function to
each spectrogram coefficient.  Here, that user-defined function is a
lambda expression that multiplies the coefficient by the appropriate
precalculated frequency-dependent gain, modifying the coefficient in
place.  The unused <code>int64_t</code> argument is the time in units
of samples; this could be use to implement a time-varying filter if desired.</p>
<pre>
        apply(analyzer, coefs,
            [&amp;](std::complex&lt;float&gt; &amp;coef, int band, int64_t) {
                coef *= band_gains[band];
            });
</pre>

<h2>Resynthesis</h2>
<p>We can now resynthesize audio from the filtered coefficients by
calling <code>synthesize()</code>.  This is a mirror image of the call to
<code>analyze()</code>: now the coefficients are the input, and
the buffer of samples is the output.  The <code>channel</code>
vector that originally contained the input samples for the channel
is now reused to hold the output samples.</p>
<pre>
        analyzer.synthesize(coefs, 0, channel.size(), channel.data());
</pre>

<h2>Re-interleaving</h2>
<p>The <code>audio</code> vector that contained the
original interleaved audio is reused for the interleaved
filtered audio.  This concludes the loop over the channels.
</p>
<pre>
        for (sf_count_t i = 0; i &lt; n_frames; i++)
            audio[i * sfinfo.channels + ch] = channel[i];
    }
</pre>

<h2>Writing the Audio</h2>
<p>The filtered audio is written using <i>libsndfile</i>,
using code that closely mirrors that for reading.
Note that we use <code>SFC_SET_CLIPPING</code>
to make sure that any samples too loud for the file format
will saturate; by default, <i>libsndfile</i> makes them
wrap around, which sounds really bad.</p>
<pre>
    SNDFILE *sf_out = sf_open(argv[2], SFM_WRITE, &amp;sfinfo);
    if (! sf_out) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "could not open output audio file\n";
        exit(1);
    }
    sf_command(sf_out, SFC_SET_CLIPPING, NULL, SF_TRUE);
    sf_count_t n_written = sf_writef_float(sf_out, audio.data(), n_frames);
    if (n_written != n_frames) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; "write error\n";
        exit(1);
    }
    sf_close(sf_out);
</pre>

<h2>Postamble</h2>
<p>
We need a couple more lines of boilerplate to make the example a
complete program:
</p>
<pre>
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>Like <a href="render.html">Example 1</a>, this example
can be built using a one-line build command:
</p>
<pre class="build Darwin Linux NetBSD">
c++ -std=c++11 -I.. -O3 -ffast-math `pkg-config --cflags sndfile` filter.cc `pkg-config --libs sndfile` -o filter
</pre>
<p>Or using the vDSP FFT on macOS:</p>
<pre class="build Darwin">
c++ -std=c++11 -I.. -O3 -ffast-math -DGABORATOR_USE_VDSP `pkg-config --cflags sndfile` filter.cc `pkg-config --libs sndfile` -framework Accelerate -o filter
</pre>
<p>Or using PFFFT (see <a href="render.html">Example 1</a> for how to download and build PFFFT):</p>
<pre class="build Linux NetBSD">
c++ -std=c++11 -I.. -Ipffft -O3 -ffast-math -DGABORATOR_USE_PFFFT `pkg-config --cflags sndfile` filter.cc pffft/pffft.o pffft/fftpack.o `pkg-config --libs sndfile` -o filter
</pre>

<h2>Running</h2>
<p>To filter the file <code>guitar.wav</code> that was downloaded in
Example 1, simply run</p>
<pre class="run">
./filter guitar.wav guitar_filtered.wav
</pre>
<p>The resulting lowpass filtered audio in <code>guitar_filtered.wav</code> will
sound muffled compared to the original, but less so than it would with a
6&nbsp;dB/octave filter.</p>

<h2>Frequency response</h2>
<p>The following plot shows the actual measured frequency response of the
filter, with the expected 3 dB/octave slope above 20&nbsp;Hz and minimal
ripple:</p>
